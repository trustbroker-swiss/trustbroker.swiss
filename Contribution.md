## How to create a Change Request

Please go to discussions and describe your issue there. The better you describe the topic, the issue you have, the benefit and
your requirements to generate a useful solution for you, the better we can evaluate options and whether we can fulfil your
request.
At least we will state how we would approach your problem.

## How to create a Pull Request

We have not yet decided, how code can be contributed. As a matter of fact, no one contributed so far, which is a real pity.
